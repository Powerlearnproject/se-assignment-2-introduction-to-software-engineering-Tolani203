Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Software Engineering is a methodical rigorous and quantitative approach to the creation, use and upkeep of software. In order to create dependable, effective and high quality software,it entails applying engineering concepts to the software creation process.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
software engineering is the disciplined aplication of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software systems. It differ from traditinaol programming in the following ways:
1.Scope and Appoach: Traditional programming focuses primarily on writing codes to solve specific problems while software engineering encompasses a broader scope including system design, testing, maintenance etc.
2.Process and Mmethodology: Traditional programming may lack formalized processes and methodologies, often relies on the programmer's skills and experience while software engineering utilizes structured methodologies and processes to ensure systematic and organized development.
3.Team and collaboration: Traditional programming, often done by individuals or small teams requires less emphasis on collaborative processes and communication while software engineering typically involves large teams with specialized roles e.g developers, testers, project managers etc.
4.Quality and Testing: Software engineering incorporates formal testing strategies and quality assurance practices to ensure software reliability and performance while in traditional programming, testing may be less rigorous and often performed by the person who wrote the code.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
The Software Development Life Cycle is a framework that defines the steps involved in the development of software from inception to deployment and maintenance.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
1.Requirement Analysis: This phase involves gathering and documenting the functional and non functional requirement of the software from the stakeholders.
2.System Design: In this phase, the system's architecture and design are planned based on the requirement gathered.
3.Implementation[Coding]: This phase involves translating the system's design into actual code. Ddevelopers write the software using programming languages and tools.
4.Testing: Testing is carried out to identify defects and ensure that the software meets the specified requirements.
5.Deployment: This phase ensures that the software is correctly installed and configured in its target environment.
6.Maintenance: The software is maintained to fix bugs, improve performance and add new features.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
1.Approach: Waterfall is sequential and rigid while Agile is iterative and flexible.
2.Flexibility:In Waterfall, it is is difficult to make changes once a phase is completed, while in Agile, it is easy to adapt to changes throughout the develpment process.
3.Customer Involvement: The waterfall Model is limited to the requirement phase and final delivery while Agile has continous involvement and feedback from the customers throughout the project.
4.Delivery: Waterfall does a single delivery at the end of the project while Agile does frequent, incremental deliveries throughout the project.
5.Risk Management:In Waterfall, Risk are identified and managed in the early phases but changes later can be costly while in AGILE, risks are continuously identified and mitigated throughout the project.
WATERFALL Models is best for projects with clear, unchanging requirements while AGILE is better for projects requiring flexibility and ongoing user feedbacks.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting and maintaining the requirement for a software system.
Process of Rrequirements engineering:
1.Requirement Elicitation:Gathering requirements from stakeholders through different techniques.
2.Requirement Analysis:Analyzing the gathered requirements to make sure they are complete, consistent and feasible.
3.Requirement Specification:documenting the requirements in a clear and concise manner.
4.Requirement validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect the needs and expectations of stakeholders.
5.Requirement Management: Making changes to the requirements throughout the project lifecycle.
Importance of Requirement engineering:
1.Clarity and understanding.
2.Reduced risk of failure
3.Improved comunication
4.Foundation for design and development
5.Cost and time efficiency
6.Quality assurance
7.Scope Management.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
odularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into smaller,self contained units or modules each of which encapsulates a specific piece of functionality.
How Modularity improves maintainability and scalability
1.Isolation of changes
2.Simlified debugging and testing
3.Clearer code structure.
4.Parallel development
5.Load distribution
6.Resource management
7. incremental upgrade 
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1.Unit testing:involves testing individual component or units of code, typically functions or methods in isolation. This is to verify that each unit perform as expected.
2.Integration testing: focuses on verifying the interaction between integrated units or components. It ensure that the combined part of the system works together correctly.
3.System testing:involves testing the complete and integated software system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
4.Acceptance testing:is the final level of testing conducted to detemine whether the system meets the accceptance criteria and is ready for deployment.It is often performed by the end users or clients.
Testing is crucial in software development because it ensures quality and reliability, detects and fixes bug easily,validates functionality, enhances security and improves performance.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control systems are essential tools in software development,enabling collaboration, maintaining a comprehensive history of changes, providing backup and recovery, managing releases and ensuring taceability.
Popular Version Control Systems and Their Features

1.Git:
